# Chi-square_Shirley_Huilin

In this app, we will introduce chi-square goodness-fit-test with examples.

The purpose of this app is to teach the user the characteristics, and algorithms of the chi-square goodness fit test. We improve the introduction, instruction, structure, and functions: getting it more user-friendly and more helpful for users to understand the aim of this app. 

The original design requires the user to know what is the chi-square test. But the aim of this app is to teach users of chi-square test. This is a conflict.
